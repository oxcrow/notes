# Implementing Lexer and Parser

Ix is being developed to be an efficient systems programming
language. Thus one of our most critical mission objectives is to lex
and parse approximately 10 Millions lines of code per second.

While this might seem like an ambitious goal. This is actually
possible as shown by Chandler Carruth for Carbon
[[1]](ihttps://youtu.be/ZI198eFghJk?t=1458) and Andrew Kelley for Zig
[[2]](https://youtu.be/IroPQ150F6c?t=2567). While there are many
design decisions and optimizations required to reach this performance
benchmark I state them now so we have an ambitious goal to strive
towards.
