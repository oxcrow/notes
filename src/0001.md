# Implementing Lexer and Parser

Ix is being developed to be a hyper efficient systems programming
language. Thus one of the most critical mission goals of Ix compiler
is to lex and parse at least 10 Millions lines of code per second.

While this might seem like an ambitious goal. This is actually
possible as shown by Chandler Carruth for Carbon
[1](ihttps://youtu.be/ZI198eFghJk?t=1458) and Andrew Kelley for Zig
[2](https://youtu.be/IroPQ150F6c?t=2567). While there are many things
required to reach this performance benchmark, I state them now
to mark them as our objectives, so we have goal to strive towards.
